### Accent Colors

To achieve a synthwave or vaporwave feel, a complementary purple accent will enhance the aesthetic and blend well with the existing blues.

- **Neon Purple** (#A020F0)
  - **Use**: This vibrant purple has a strong neon quality, making it an ideal accent for a synthwave look. It contrasts well with the electric blue and can be used sparingly to highlight specific elements, giving a retro-futuristic vibe.


## Typography

Our primary typeface is [**Montserrat Semi-Bold**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat), modified for a tighter width to give a modern, streamlined appearance that aligns with Transcensionâ€™s tech-focused identity.

**Font Pairing**: For body text in longer documents, pair Montserrat with simple sans-serif fonts like Arial or Helvetica to maintain a clean and professional look.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Logo Spacing**: Ensure sufficient whitespace around the logo for clarity and impact.
- **Accent Colors**: Use **Electric Blue (#007ACC)** sparingly to highlight interactive or key elements and **Gray (#C0C0C0)** for softer background sections or secondary content.
- **Neutral Balance**: Use **Gray (#C0C0C0)** for subtle design elements like borders, backgrounds, and secondary text, enhancing readability without competing with primary colors.
